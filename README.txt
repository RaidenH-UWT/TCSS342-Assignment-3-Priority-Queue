1) How much time did you spend on this assignment?
About 3-4 hours.

2) What challenges did you face with this assignment and what kind of help did you seek to overcome these challenges?
The biggest challenge I faced was dealing with the generic types. Java doesn't have the
infrastructure to do what I want to with it (that I know of) so I just had to suppress
a bunch of warnings. I got help from my learning group to make sure I wasn't missing some
detail that would help me out.

3) What are some things you did really well on this assignment?
I'm happy with how quickly I figured out both the heapify implementations. They didn't
take me as long as I expected them to.

4) If you could do this assignment over what would you do differently?
I might try to do it in a different language, just to avoid the warnings.
